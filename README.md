Demo #2
# Creating Your First HTML Page

## Overview
This demo will teach you how to create a simple HTML page from scratch. You'll learn the basic structure of an HTML document and how to view it in your web browser.

## What You'll Create
A simple "Hello World" HTML page featuring:
- Basic HTML document structure
- Head section with title
- Body section with content
- Proper HTML5 doctype declaration

## Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, or even Notepad)

## Instructions

## Step 1: Complete the HTML Structure

1. Open the file `index.html` in your text editor
2. You'll see a basic HTML structure that needs to be completed:
   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html>
   </html>
   ```

3. Add the missing elements to create a complete HTML page:
   - Add a `<head>` section with a `<title>` element
   - Add a `<body>` section with your content
   - Include a `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag for proper character encoding

## Step 2: Run the Page in Your Browser

1. Save the `index.html` file
2. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
3. Drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser window
   
   OR
   
   Right-click the `index.html` file and select "Open with" â†’ Choose your browser
   
   OR
   
   Double-click the `index.html` file (if your browser is set as the default)

4. You should see "Hello, world!" displayed in your browser!

## What You're Creating

Your HTML page has:

### Document Structure:
- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: `<!doctype html>` tells the browser this is HTML5
- **HTML Element**: The root element containing everything
- **Head Section**: Contains metadata about the page
- **Body Section**: Contains the visible content

### Key Elements:
- **`<title>`**: Sets the page title (shown in browser tab)
- **`<meta charset="utf-8">`**: Ensures proper text encoding
- **`<body>`**: Contains the main content users see

## Understanding HTML Basics

1. **Tags**: HTML uses tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` to structure content
2. **Opening and Closing**: Most tags have opening `<tag>` and closing `</tag>` versions
3. **Nesting**: Tags can be nested inside other tags
4. **Attributes**: Tags can have attributes like `lang="en"` for language

## Customization Ideas

Try these modifications to experiment:
- Change the title text
- Add more content to the body
- Use different HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`
- Add your name instead of "world"

## Troubleshooting

- **Page not loading**: Make sure the file is saved with `.html` extension
- **Text looks wrong**: Check that you included the charset meta tag
- **Browser shows code**: Make sure the file has `.html` extension, not `.txt`
- **Nothing displays**: Check that your HTML tags are properly closed

## Project Structure

Your project looks like this:
```
starter/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Your HTML file
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # This instruction file
```

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this basic HTML page, you can:
- Add more content and formatting
- Learn about CSS for styling
- Explore more HTML elements
- Create multiple pages and link them together

Congratulations! You've created your first HTML page! ðŸŽ‰
